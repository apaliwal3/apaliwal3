## 🚀 About Me

I’m a Computer Science and Data Science graduate, focused on building reliable, high-impact systems at the intersection of software engineering and machine learning.

My experience spans computer vision for autonomous vehicles, full-stack web development, and data-driven ML modeling. I’ve worked in both research-style and production environments—deploying deep learning models on embedded GPUs, migrating large-scale dashboards used by real clients, and building end-to-end applications from database design to deployment.

I’m especially interested in:

- Machine learning systems that perform under real-world constraints

- Computer vision, perception, and generative models

- Scalable backend and full-stack applications

- Clean, maintainable code and thoughtful system design

Outside of coursework, I enjoy shipping projects that combine ML with practical software engineering, contributing to team-based engineering efforts, and continuously leveling up my understanding of how systems behave in production.

I’m always open to collaboration, internships, and projects that push technical depth and real-world impact.
